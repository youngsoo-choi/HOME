<h2> CSS </h2>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/" target="_blank" title="html5 specification">
  Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</a> is a markup language, a language that
  describes how the actual display [1] , HTML and XHTML mainly used in,
  XML can be used in. It is a W3C standard and has a high degree of freedom
  in defining layout and style.</p>

<p> If the markup language (ex. HTML) is the body of the website, CSS can be
  said to serve as a decoration for clothes and accessories.
  In other words, you can decorate it like any other website by changing
  the CSS file without changing the HTML structure.</p>

<p>In the case of CSS3, which is currently under development , the ability to
  replace images produced by graphic editing programs such as shadow effects,
  gradients, and transformations has been added.
  Also, various animation functions have been added to replace Adobe Flash to
  some extent.</p>
